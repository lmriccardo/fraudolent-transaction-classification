# Fraudolent Transaction Classification

This is the repository of the project for the Big Data Computing course at La Sapienza.

## Introduction

Financial fraud is a problem that has proved to be a menance and has a huge impact on the financial industry. Data mining is one of the techniques which has played an important role in credit card fraud detection in transactions which are online. Credit card fraud detection has proved to be a challenge mainly due to the 2 problems that it poses: both the profiles of fraudolent and normal behaviours change and data sets used are highly skewed. The performance of fraud detection is affected by the variables used and the technique used to detect fraud.

With this project I'm going to experiment different Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a transaction has an high probability of being fraudolent or not. To this end, I'm going to use: *Decision Trees*, *Random Forest*, (simple) *Logistic Regression* and (maybe) *Neural Network* (from scratch) approach.
