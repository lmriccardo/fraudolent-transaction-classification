Financial fraud is a problem that has proved to be a menance and has a huge impact on the financial industry. Data mining is one of the techniques which has played an important role in credit card fraud detection in transactions which are online. Credit card fraud detection has proved to be a challenge mainly due to the 2 problems that it poses: both the profiles of fraudolent and normal behaviours change and data sets used are highly skewed.
